# Coding Challenges
Solutions to periodic coding problems used to build my problem-solving skills.

Welcome! I use this space to showcase my programming abilities by producing solutions to coding problems commonly used for interview questions or otherwise.

Languages:
I will be using C++ and Python primarily as I start working through the challenges. As I build knowledge in other languages, I will add code that incorporates their language. 

Compilers:
- C++ : Unless otherwise noted, I am using the most recent version of G++ available at: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mingw-w64-gcc/

This repo is separated into two main categories:
1. Interview questions - From https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/
2. Random problems - Questions I'm interested in solving as I go through my daily life

Thanks for checking out my repo, and feel free to contact me if you don't like my solutions to these problems, or if you have a better way to solve the problem!
