# Daily-Challenges
Daily challenges and solutions to coding problems, to build my problem-solving skills.

Welcome! This is a place I use to showcase my programming forte by consistently producing code in the forms of "Daily challenges" for interview questions or otherwise.

Languages:
I will be using C++ and Python primarily as I start working through the challenges. As I build knowledge in other languages, I will add code that incorporates their language. 

Compilers:
- C++ : Unless otherwise noted, I am using the most recent version of G++ available at: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mingw-w64-gcc/

This repo is separated into two main categories:
1. Interview questions - From https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/
2. Random problems - Questions I'm interested in solving as I go through my daily life

Thanks for checking out my repo, and feel free to contact me if you don't like my solutions to these problems, or if you have a better way to solve the problem!
